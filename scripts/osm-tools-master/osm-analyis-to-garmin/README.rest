OSM Analysis to Garmin
======================

This directory contains a tool to convert the data from ITO World's `OSM
Analysis`_ into a Garmin image file. The ``run.sh`` script is the main entry to
the script.

It fetches all the data by looping over all the names in ``names.txt`` so that
those areas are fetched by screen-scraping from the OSM Analysis website.  If
you're only interested in one area, just make sure the ``names.txt`` file just
contains that name.

It then creates a ``template.args`` file by running ``process-names.php``.  The
created file is then used by the ``convert.sh`` script to create the Garmin
specific ``.img`` files and the ``gmapsupp.img`` file. If you run those scripts
yourself, **please** modify the ``family-id`` parameter in ``convert.sh``.  You
also should change the ``$baseMapId`` value in ``process-names.php``.
