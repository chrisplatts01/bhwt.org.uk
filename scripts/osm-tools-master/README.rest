OSM Tools
=========

This repository contains a set of tools that use OpenStreetMap data.

The ``lib/`` directory contains two PHP files. One for writing OSM files
(``osm-writer.php``) and one file (``convert.php``) containing classes for
converting from the UK National Grid to latitude/longitude as well as routines
to convert between OSGB36 and WGS84.

The ``mkgmap-styles/`` directory contains styles to use with mkgmap_. There is
my normal style (``mkgmap-styles/derick``) and one that is used together with
the ``osm-analysis-to-garmin`` tool (``mkgmap-styles/osmanalysis``).

The ``osm-analyis-to-garmin/`` directory contains a tool to convert the data
from ITO World's `OSM Analysis`_ into a Garmin image file. See the
`osm-analysis-to-garmin`_ directory for a README on it.
